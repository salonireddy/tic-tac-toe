# tic-tac-toe
- This is a generic 2 player tic tac toe game I made in C++. It works perfectly without using any external libraries, completes with comments describing what is being done by a specific code snippet. 
- I do plan to commit some changes and extend this project by implementing AI concepts to design an interface for a single player to play against the computer.
  - In the initial draft, I'll design a pseudo AI wherein the computer will place a marker randomly in an empty slot
  - Following this, I'll apply some hueristic algorithms to make a somewhat efficient computer opponent
